For this project, I worked on training a pirate-themed intelligent agent using reinforcement learning. I was given starter code that set up the environment and agent class. From there, I wrote and adjusted my own code to implement Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) so the agent could make smarter decisions over time. I built out the model, updated the training loop, added logic for exploration vs. exploitation, and tracked the rewards so I could see the agent improving.

This course helped me understand how reinforcement learning and neural networks actually apply to real-world problems. Computer scientists solve problems using code, logic, and math—especially when dealing with things like AI. It’s not just about writing code that works, but about thinking through how systems learn, adapt, and make decisions. This project showed how an agent can learn from trial and error, just like in games or robotics.

As a computer scientist, I’ve learned to break problems into smaller parts. When something didn’t work, I used debugging tools, printed outputs, and tested small pieces at a time until I figured it out. That mindset helped me stay focused and not get overwhelmed when tuning my model or tweaking reward functions.

I’ve also learned that I have a responsibility to think about how my code affects people. With intelligent systems especially, it’s important to make sure the decisions being made are fair, unbiased, and secure. If this agent were used in something real—like finance or healthcare—it would be my job to protect users and act responsibly.

This was one of my favorite projects because I could actually see the agent learn over time. It felt like something real, and it showed how much I’ve grown with Python, Jupyter, and machine learning tools.
